## FAQ

**Q: Is my speech sent to the internet?**  
A: No. All recognition is done locally on your computer.

**Q: Why does the app download a model?**  
A: The first time you use a language, the app downloads a small offline speech model (~50MB).

**Q: Can I use this for streaming or presentations?**  
A: Yes! The overlay is designed to be unobtrusive and customizable.

**Q: How do I capture audio from Discord/Teams/other apps?**  
A: Select the application from the "Listening from" dropdown. Note: You may need to configure your system's audio routing (like enabling "Stereo Mix") to capture application audio.

**Q: Why don't I see my application in the list?**  
A: Click the refresh button (it's supposed to look like this ðŸ”„, but is kinda wierd) to update the list, or make sure the application is currently running.

**Q: How do I move the overlay?**  
A: Use the position and preset controls in the app window.

- **Microphone not detected:** Make sure your microphone is plugged in and selected as the default recording device.
- **Model download fails:** Check your internet connection and try again.
- **Overlay not visible:** Try adjusting opacity, font size, or position.
